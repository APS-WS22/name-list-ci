# How to contribute
These are the steps to follow to contribute code into the repository.

## Pull Requests
* Always create a fork of the repository and create a Pull Request with your changes. The default `main` branch is protected.
* The build job has to pass, otherwise your Pull Request is not mergeable.
* Commit messages should follow a common format. See the [Commit Message](#commit-message) section below.
* Write a convincing description of your PR and why we should land it.

## Commit Message
The project requires that commit messages start with an uppercase letter and have at least two words.
